                Textiles are often used to define certain spaces, shifting from two dimensional sheets to three-dimensional entities.
                <br>
                This way they become a tool and a medium to reinterpret, modify and understand our surroundings.
                <br>
                <br>
                In a similar way, flags are just rectangular pieces of fabric that define spaces 
                (political, geographical, physical, economical, virtual, commercial, ideal) and hold several meanings. 
                <br>
                Their structure of values is related to - and dependant on - their materiality, in which every color, shape, sewing stitch or 
                mark acts as a symbol for something they aim to portray. 
                <br>
                A flag can represent entire nations, identity, loyalty and a sense of belonging, therefore it is supposed to be treated in a 
                respectful and honorable manner.
                <br>
                The so called "flag-code" is what most countries came up with, under a legal perspective, to preserve and protect 
                those values that the flag holds embedded in its physicality. <i>If you disrespect the flag, you are disrespecting the 
                country.</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                The same legally regulated physicality, however, can be exploited as a tool for expression and friction for those who are on 
                the opposite side.
                <br>
                Knowing the law, the "flag-code", means that you can have direct access to a flag's meaning, how it is protected and 
                what its materiality entails.
