            Design and the deep future, with Alice Twemlow 
            <br>
            Collaborative project
        </p>
        <p>
            Using methods drawn form archaeology, material culture studies and critical design, this project is a speculation 
            on the designed entities that will become human traces in the earth’s geological strata. 
            <br>
            The focus is on the correlation between physical and digital degradation of objects and media, 
            and the archaeological (mis)interpretation of the fossils of the future.
            <br> 
            It is an exploration of the meaning of concepts like deep time and hyperobjects, through a fictional case study taken from a not so distant future.
            <br>
            <br>
            What is the life span of a digital file, trapped in the degrading carcass of the USB-stick hosting it, with its plastic case and microchips? 
            What is the process of archaeological restoration of a fossil digital file found inside its rotting, decaying body? 
            What happens when data is misinterpreted through the decoding process?
            <br>
            <br>
            The outcomes of this project included ceramic objects, written texts, images, soundscapes and a collectively produced publication.
            <br>
            The project was developed within Alice Twemlow’s <a href="https://www.kabk.nl/en/lectorates/design/design-and-the-deep-future" target="_blank">Design and the Deep Future</a> Lab.
